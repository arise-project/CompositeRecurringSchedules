# Research for solution.

If I can found all types of {value} and begin and end of every sentence then I probably have solution.
Results for types list can be present in filled class fields or with map [string, object].
Defined fileds with types can be configured with json.

1) Main idea to idel alhoritm is writing it from scratch.

2) Utilize code from import "text/template/parse" 
through dynamic wrapping or revriting a code or preprocessig 
and pre analyse to find appropriate struct to extract.extract
This method may be quick implementation byt it should be 
compared to algoritm from scratch.

3) Third mwthod will be more elegant. Idea in learning perseprton 
to fill fields from one stuct instead of mulltiple will be 
very possible. Also should be compared by performanse with other methods.
